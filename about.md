<img itemprop="image" class="img-rounded" src="/assets/img/blog-author.jpg" alt="Emanuele Pasqualotto">Hi, there!

My name is Emanuele (*eh-m-ah-n-oo-eh-l-eh*) and I come from the wonderful city of Rome.

I am a cognitive neuroscientist at the [CoActions Lab][coactions], [Université catholique de Louvain][ucl] in Brussels, Belgium. I have studied Psychology and obtained a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience. Beside Italy and Belgium, I also spent a few years in Germany (Tübingen) during and after my doctoral work.

I like (not in this order) jogging in the morning, working with [Python][python], hoppy beers, science and data stuff, drum'n'bass. But many other things, too.

My research interests focus on [brain-computer interfaces][bci](BCIs), [motor imagery][imagery], mental effort and [cognitive workload][workload], but also on many aspects regarding the [human-computer interaction][hci](HCI). You can check my [Scholar][googlescholar] page to get an idea on what I already published.

 You can also find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin], [ResearchGate][ReGa], and [Twitter][twitter].
