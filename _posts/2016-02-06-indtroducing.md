title: Introducing...

This website comes from the desire to have my own space where to put occasional thoughts, to present updates on my most recent work, or to write about any nifty programming solution I came up with (or, most probable, that I found around).

To build up this website I used [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator that does not require a database. It's very easy to use and leaves quite some freedom for developing your own plugin. To create the layout, I used a combination of [Poole][poole], parts of [Willian Justen template][will], and my own taste. Thanks to Willian, I also got used to [Gulp][gulp], a tool to automate tasks, and [Stylus][], a dynamic stylesheet language which I enjoyed for its easiness and tidiness.
